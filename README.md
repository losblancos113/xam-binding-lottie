# Xamarin binding for Lottie ([iOS]((https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android)) and [Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android))

Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as json with [bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) and renders the vector animations natively on mobile and through React Native!



For the first time, designers can create **and ship** beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand.
Since the animation is backed by JSON they are extremely small in size but can be large in complexity!
Animations can be played, resized, looped, sped up, slowed down, and even interactively scrubbed.

Lottie also supports native UIViewController Transitions out of the box!

## Install Lottie
`TODO: Create nugets`

## Using Lottie
Lottie animations can be loaded from bundled JSON or from a URL

The simplest way to use it is with LAAnimationView:
```c#
LAAnimationView animation = LAAnimationView.AnimationNamed("LottieLogo1");
View.AddSubWiew(animation);
animation.Play();
```

```xml
<com.airbnb.lottie.LottieAnimationView
        android:id="@+id/animation_view"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:lottie_fileName="hello-world.json"
        app:lottie_loop="true"
        app:lottie_autoPlay="true" />
```

Or you can load it programmatically from a NSURL
```c#
LAAnimationView animation = new LAAnimationView(xurl);
View.AddSubWiew(animation);
animation.Play();
```

Lottie supports the iOS `UIViewContentModes` aspectFit and aspectFill

Lottie comes with a `UIViewController` animation-controller for making custom viewController transitions!

```c#
[Export("animationControllerForPresentedController:presentingController:sourceController:")]
public IUIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning AnimationControllerForPresentedController(
    UIViewController presented,
    UIViewController presenting,
    UIViewController source)
{
    return new LAAnimationTransitionController("vcTransition1", "outLayer", "inLayer");
}

[Export("animationControllerForDismissedController:")]
public IUIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning AnimationControllerForDismissedController(UIViewController dismissed)
{
    return new LAAnimationTransitionController("vcTransition2", "outLayer", "inLayer");
}

```

If your animation will be frequently reused, `LAAnimationView` has an built in LRU Caching Strategy.

## Try it out

## Alternatives
1. Build animations by hand. Building animations by hand is a huge time commitment for design and engineering across Android and iOS. It's often hard or even impossible to justify spending so much time to get an animation right.
2. [Facebook Keyframes](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Keyframes). Keyframes is a wonderful new library from Facebook that they built for reactions. However, Keyframes doesn't support some of Lottie's features such as masks, mattes, trim paths, dash patterns, and more.
2. Gifs. Gifs are more than double the size of a bodymovin JSON and are rendered at a fixed size that can't be scaled up to match large and high density screens.
3. Png sequences. Png sequences are even worse than gifs in that their file sizes are often 30-50x the size of the bodymovin json and also can't be scaled up.

## Why is it called Lottie?
Lottie is named after a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation. Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) â€“ the oldest surviving feature-length animated film, preceding Walt Disney's feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) by over ten years

## Contributing
Contributors are more than welcome. Just upload a PR with a description of your changes.

If you would like to add more JSON files feel free to do so!

## Issues or feature requests?
File github issues for anything that is unexpectedly broken. If an After Effects file is not working, please attach it to your issue. Debugging without the original file is much more difficult.

## Roadmap (In no particular order)
- Add support for interactive animated transitions
- Add support for parenting programmatically added layers, moving/scaling
- Support for the After Effects Trim Paths Offset feature
- Animation Syncing
- Programmatically alter animations
- Animation Breakpoints/Seekpoints
- Gradients
- LAAnimatedButton
- Repeater objects
